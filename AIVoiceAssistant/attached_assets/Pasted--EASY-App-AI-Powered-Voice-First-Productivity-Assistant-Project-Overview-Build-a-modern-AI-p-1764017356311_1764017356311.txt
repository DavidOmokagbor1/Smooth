# EASY App - AI-Powered Voice-First Productivity Assistant

## Project Overview
Build a modern, AI-powered productivity app called "EASY" that helps users with ADHD, bipolar disorder, overwhelm, and everyday stress to intelligently prioritize tasks through voice interaction. The app should feel like having a supportive, smart personal assistant similar to Siri.

## Core Features & Requirements

  - Emotional context ("stressed about", "worried", "excited")
  - Task complexity and estimated duration
- **Contextual Understanding**: Remember previous tasks and user patterns
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Proactively suggest task breakdowns for complex items
- **Mood Detection**: Adjust responses based on user's emotional state

2. Analyze priority markers: ["boss" = high priority, "maybe" = optional]
3. Categorize:
   - Do Now: "Complete report for boss 📄"
   - Do Later: "Buy groceries 🛒"
   - Optional: "Clean room 🏠"
4. Response: "I've organized your tasks! The report seems most urgent. Would you like me to break it down into smaller steps?"
```

#### Supportive AI Responses:
- "Great job getting this down! Let's tackle these one at a time."
- "I notice you have a lot on your plate. Should we focus on just the essentials today?"
- "You're doing amazing! Remember, progress over perfection."
- "Would you like me to remind you about the report in 2 hours?"
